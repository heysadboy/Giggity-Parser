				<description><p>Last year at Burning Man 2015, we demonstrated an open hardware &amp; software, 900 MHz radio-connected platform based on our Orchard IoT platform in the form of a conference badge. The badges bore a circular set of LEDs which would flash in a pattern unique to that badge. Attendees with other badges customized their light patterns by finding badges with patterns they like and "having sex" with them. The description of the light patterns is based on a diploid genome, and the process of breeding lights is modeled after the biological process of having sex. The overall protocol to exchange light genomes was designed to require explicit consent of both parties, thus layering a social experiment on top of a hardware experiment. By requiring explicit consent, the badges also served as an icebreaker and a seed for many fun conversations.</p></description>

				<description><p>The YouthMobile Initiative builds on the experience of many worldwide initiatives that introduce young people to computer science programming (learning-to-code) and problem solving (coding-to-learn). It also seeks to build on experiences targeting young women who are vastly underrepresented in this field. Finally it builds on the consideration that for millions of young people, the smartphone in their pocket is a very powerful computer, it will be their only computer, and they use it for nearly every aspect of their lives: communicating, learning, taking pictures, and playing games.</p></description>

				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>“The Other Nefertiti” is an artistic intervention by Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al- Badri which went viral. “With the data leak as a part of this counter narrative within our investigative practice we want to activate the artefact, to inspire a critical re-assessment of today’s conditions and to overcome the colonial notion of possession in Germany's museums”. With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the “Global North“ deals with heritage and the representation of “the Other”. “We should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.“   At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain:  <a href="http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>   Here is the video showing the scanning process:  <a href="https://vimeo.com/148156899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  “The Other Nefertiti”  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing “The Other” always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .</p></description>

				<description><p>Legalese helps entrepreneurs take the law into their own hands, by turning contracts into templates, configuration, and code – all on Github. Instead of paying lawyers for access to their proprietary precedents, founders and freelancers can use opensource tools to draft their own NDAs, ESOPs, and angel/seed investment agreements. After a short demo of the system we escalate quickly into a review of the 30-year history of legal informatics, deontic calculi, and programming language theory which Legalese is now productizing with its own DSL.</p></description>

				<description><p>The IoT is poised to change how we interact with and perceive the world around us, and the possibilities are nearly boundless. As more and more connected devices generate data, we will need to solve the problem of how to collect, store, and make sense of IoT data by leveraging the power of database systems. MySQL 5.7 is the best release ever of the world's most popular open source database and provides a new, advanced feature set designed to enable those who are building the next generation of web-based and embedded applications and services including IoT and BigData.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>This presentation is about the Sensor Plug-ins developed for ExpEYES: Pocket Science Lab as a part of my GSoC-2015 project with FOSSASIA. We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc.  With this development we at FOSSASIA are aiming to provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world.  I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everyday…..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.</p></description>

				<description><p>In this 2 hour workshop, we will be introducing the idea of Design Making and how it can be relevant to Education today.Design Making is an approach to problem solving with a focus on making-and-iterating. Tapping on the idea of Design Thinking, making turns concepts into actual prototypes and getting it to market for feedback allows robust iterations to happen for a better product-demand fit.</p></description>

				<description><p>NVDIMM is very hot topic now a days. It has many fabulous features. One of them is namespaces. NVDIMM support block and persistent memory name spaces. Both has different advantages and use cases. Namespaces may have attributes unavailable through other means, like different block sizes for block devices, the choice of powerfail write atomicity, and the ability. Let’s understand block window, BTT, SPA and their challenges in this session. I will cover how NVDIMM is solving modern memory requirement. Based on its ability to fill the gap between cache memory and SSD. I will cover how Linux community is proceeding to solve namespaces in NVDIMM.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>The number of electronic devices we have around us is gigantic. We need a new interaction model to deal with all these devices, and having a separate native app for each device is impractical. The concept of the ‘Physical Web’ attempts to assign devices with their very own URL, which can be accessed by everyone using their web browser.   This opens up a lot of possibilities for developers to create new and amazing applications, taking the user’s immediate physical presence into play. We’ll take a look at some use cases, including, but not limited to treasure hunts, contact sharing and indoor navigation. We’ll dive deep into how JavaScript can be used along with Bluetooth-LE and the Eddystone protocol to create great web apps, and understand  the concepts at hand.</p></description>

				<description><p>Micro Bit (or micro:bit) is an ARM-based embedded system designed by the BBC for use in computer education in the UK. It will be given to every 11 year old student in UK.   MicroPython is an "official" solution for the micro:bit. The Python Software Foundation are one of the partners in the project and the BBC asked us to provide such a solution (ntoll is leading the efforts from the PSF side of things).   "Mu" is a community generated (i.e. from the Python community) editor that *initially* targets the micro:bit. In the wider Python context, there's been talk of a kid/teacher/beginner friendly editor that's recommended for Python "in general". Plans are afoot to make "mu" meet this requirement.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Yaniv will present overview of oVirt, Foreman and Katello, then will dive into how oVirt integrates with Foreman and Katello to ease different flows in variant systems and data-centers. oVirt 3.5 integration with Foreman allows us to bring new bare-metal hardware to a fully operational hypervisor in one click. In oVirt 3.6 we introduce an integration with Katello to allow oVirt users to see available updates (ERRATA) on hosts and VMs that are managed by Foreman, and in addition on the oVirt engine machine itself. This gives oVirt users a wider view of the updates available for both the virtualized and infrastructure resources. The integration between the projects is still in progress and we plan add functionality to it for better management options for various entities in the data-center hardware - such as provision phase, package management, configurations control and upgrade flows.</p></description>

				<description><p>Open Detection (OD) is a novel standalone open source project for object detection and recognition in images and 3D point clouds. Open Detection is released under the terms of the BSD license, and thus free for commercial and research use. The project was originated under Google Summer of Code 2015 with the aim of having a vision tool for robotics (in particular for Robocomp, an open source robotics framework). The library is built with a very specific goal - to answer the fundamental problem of Computer Vision - Object Recognition and Detection. We make available to everyone the existing solution in this direction in a common, intuitive and user-friendly APIs. Our simple and user-friendly APIs make this a great tool for Robotics Applications and robots and Computer Vision beginners and enthusiasts. And of course, the method dependent parameters to fine-tune detections to the limit, makes this a great tool for Computer Vision researchers and experts.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>I developed an extension - Collaborative Spelling Dictionary, during my intern with the Wikimedia Foundation under the Outreach program of Gnome. After my intern, I created issues in the same extension for newbies to fix and guided them constantly giving them an easy and smooth entry into the open source community. I also mentored the extension's issues in Google Code In this year and had several students submitting their patches for the same, successfully closing number of the open issues.  I'll use the opportunity to explain and demonstrate this extension to the FOSSASIA attendees and talk about the step by step process involved in building an extension. This would particularly be useful for anyone aiming to work on and develop extensions to be used for any wiki-project (which are already quite popular these days).    Moreover, the extension still has scope for further development. In order to be able to contribute to the extension, it is important to understand how the extension works currently, so I would like to explain about this project and its code architecture and also discuss the possible features and their implementations during my talk. I also plan on giving a demo of my work on my laptop (if time allows) so that the audience gets a better idea about the project.</p></description>

				<description><p>As the internet trickles through society it starts to transform the very places where people live. Some think it can change cities in this century as much as electricity did in the last one. The governments of the world, the weary giants of flesh and steel, also tap into this new home.  This talk will step away from the computer screen to look at the design patterns of current toolchains for the so-called "smart city" and their implications. Is there a way the free/libre open (source software) spirit can be baked into the infrastructure that society runs on?</p></description>

				<description><p>Who controls the hardware own's the hardware! Vendors taking more and more power of our devices with no return for us - the end user. They want to decide what software it runs on the hardware they sell to us. Why? Because of security. Security means to prevent the user from owning the device and gives the vendor more power to feel good. This security also restricts the usage of hardware to a certain use case. The open source world has shown there are a lot more use cases than advertised with any given hardware. The talk also gives a short overview of coreboot and how coreboot can solve some problems.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Organisational budgets are shrinking and stakeholders are putting increasing pressure on public sector organisations to be efficient without jeopardising service delivery. There is a multitude of ways to share and reuse software amongst organisations and the public sector employs (and has employed) a variety of different approaches. This session will specifically focus on open source software and the factors influencing the adoption of open source software within public sector organisations. The primary objective of the session is to explore open source software benefits for public sector organisations, discuss the current state of adoption, and review the motivators and a-motivators affecting adoption. A secondary objective of the session is to investigate where organisations are utilising open source software and whether organisations consider open source software as a means of achieving business goals.</p></description>

				<description><p>NVDIMM is very hot topic now a days. It has many fabulous features. One of them is namespaces. NVDIMM support block and persistent memory name spaces. Both has different advantages and use cases. Namespaces may have attributes unavailable through other means, like different block sizes for block devices, the choice of powerfail write atomicity, and the ability. Let’s understand block window, BTT, SPA and their challenges in this session. I will cover how NVDIMM is solving modern memory requirement. Based on its ability to fill the gap between cache memory and SSD. I will cover how Linux community is proceeding to solve namespaces in NVDIMM.</p></description>

				<description><p>The number of electronic devices we have around us is gigantic. We need a new interaction model to deal with all these devices, and having a separate native app for each device is impractical. The concept of the ‘Physical Web’ attempts to assign devices with their very own URL, which can be accessed by everyone using their web browser.   This opens up a lot of possibilities for developers to create new and amazing applications, taking the user’s immediate physical presence into play. We’ll take a look at some use cases, including, but not limited to treasure hunts, contact sharing and indoor navigation. We’ll dive deep into how JavaScript can be used along with Bluetooth-LE and the Eddystone protocol to create great web apps, and understand  the concepts at hand.</p></description>

				<description><p>Micro Bit (or micro:bit) is an ARM-based embedded system designed by the BBC for use in computer education in the UK. It will be given to every 11 year old student in UK.   MicroPython is an "official" solution for the micro:bit. The Python Software Foundation are one of the partners in the project and the BBC asked us to provide such a solution (ntoll is leading the efforts from the PSF side of things).   "Mu" is a community generated (i.e. from the Python community) editor that *initially* targets the micro:bit. In the wider Python context, there's been talk of a kid/teacher/beginner friendly editor that's recommended for Python "in general". Plans are afoot to make "mu" meet this requirement.</p></description>

				<description><p>Ring, a project from Savoir-faire Linux, creators of SFLphone, uses a distributed hash table instead of a central SIP server to find other users. This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's OpenDHT library.  Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.</p></description>

				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Demo Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Lightning talks are designed to be short presentations between five to ten minutes long, but are usually capped at five minutes. Most conferences will allot a segment of roughly 30 to 90 minutes long to speakers. Talks are arranged one after the other during the sessions. The talks are usually given at conferences in order for the event to have many speakers discuss a multitude of topics. The conferences are held in order for individuals to be able to share their ideas and concepts to people who have experience in the specific field. Lightning talks are brief which requires the speaker to make his or her point clearly and rid the presentation of non-critical information. This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.</p></description>

				<title>Distributed Multi Dimensional Anomaly Detection in OpenStack Logs</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Lightning Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Anomaly detection is very important problem and extensive research has been done about it’s various applications and domains. In this report I’ve documented my research on anomaly detection in cloud computing architectures like OpenStack, Microsoft Azure &amp; Amazon Web Services(AWS). Cloud computing systems create a big jungle of Logs and Metrics and these can provide a cloud operator tremendous insight into the systems and answer the most important questions about architecture’s health. My research shows that cloud computing architectures face completely different types of anomalies than discussed in other domains and these metrics are not very useful if used in single dimension but if we perform anomaly detection on multiple dimensions together and correlate thus generated insights with Logs we can increase our efficiency and decrease false positive cases by a huge margin. When dealing with this amount of logs and metrics we need to come up with novel distributed architectures. In this research I’ve focused on multiple dimensional anomaly detection on storm like distributed system using locality sensitive hashing and sequence mining. I hope that this research will provide us with a better understanding of different directions in which research and implementations have been done on the domain of anomaly detection, and how techniques which are proposed and implemented for a domain can be applied in different domains for which it was not initially intended to begin with.</p></description>

				<description><p>The talk will be started with a brief introduction about KDE and Labplot. Following that I will demonstrate the final result of integration between LabPlot and Cantor. I will demonstrate with the help of few python and maxima scripts what a user can do using the LabPlot. I will also give a brief about what will be its future, how this functionality will eventually help users and how can others start contributing to the code. I will then put some light on the other two projects. Firstly, Ming Ngo added visualization of 3D-data to LabPlot using the powerful VTK library. This helped data to be visualized as  points in 3D-space, curves and surfaces. Another project by Ankit Wagarde, he added a very useful tool to LabPlot that allows users to extract data from images. After importing of an image and setting the reference points, the user starts to select the data points on the image that get automatically converted into numbers.</p></description>

				<title>FarmMind Technologies</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Lightning Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>FarmMind Technologies ==================== 1        PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------------------------------------------- This smart centralized system will help farmers to take a step into precision agriculture being monitored by wireless sensors in and around their farms. This covers problems like irrigation management, crop maintenance, soil fertility maintenance, crop yield improvement, pesticide management in compliance with good agricultural practices.  2        WORK FLOW  ---------------------------- The innovation focuses on developing a smart centralized system to control different requirements for a farm per crop being grown. An IoT based system integrates the cloud AI services with that of the hardware and sensors in the farms / fields which constantly stream real-time information to the servers. Depending on various other parameters like humidity, temperature and other meteorological data, predictions of the requirements of the farm is calculated and the hardware device which automatically opens the valves for irrigation / warns the farmer about doing a scheduled check in the localized language is made via SMS. This provides a centralized GIS collection of the soil data allowing extensive research and work by the agricultural scientists to guide the farmers in a given area for the crop they're growing. Simultaneously it provides the data for governments to optimize on the water irrigation routes / canals so that other drought struck areas can ensure water in times of need. The hardware solution consists of various sensors connected to the GSM chip module on board which allows the farmers to irrigate the farms when needed or transmit data to the required scientists/soil experts in the area who could help.  •        It keeps updating the data base on parameters such as soil temperature, humidity, air temperature, determine frost and heat events, forecast harvest time. •        It maps the fields from phone using GPS and input field sampling information.  •        This systems aims for mobile first and cloud first implementation. •        It integrates pest management system by observing, inspecting, and identifying certain trends in the pests and pesticides. It keeps the track record. •        Last but not the least, it proposes high yielding plans and best crop management plans even under disasters.  3        FIELDS ARE THE NEW OFFICES AND DATA IS DRIVING THE TRACTORS  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are trying to use the emerging Cloud based technologies in AI, machine learning and big data to solve important problems as well as to get the problem notified to the related person in real time. This system allows farmers to monitor and maintain the quality of their farms by sitting at their home just using simple services like SMS in case there is no internet connectivity present in the area or by using the app built for android phones. The hardware is also sending data of the farm to the agricultural scientists who can use it to make data driven decisions. Integrations with the other meteorological information helps to offer the best advice for irrigation. This system can also be used to inform the farmers in a particular area in case of an agricultural outbreak risk in that area. The other solutions include animal breeding and maintaining the data informing the farmers about the required medication needed for the cattle. Mainly focuses on reliable, safety, interoperable, low cost implementation.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Real time tracking systems are expensive and difficult to maintain, at the same time they take a lot of network resources like 4G/3G/2G data for the mapping to a real world location. In developing countries like India where the internet is still expensive. This is exactly where our IoT platform steps in, with a mission to build a scalable and extensible real time tracking system.   We would be having a small IoT device installed in your vehicle which would able to transfer data back and forth to the server. It will help in tracking different vehicles in real time. It would be scalable to any possible vehicle runs on the road. For example, Truck owner would able to track his Trucks travelling in different part of the country, it will give him power to not only track his vehicles but also notifies him during vehicle accident. This technology is the future of the Shipping Industry, Land-Cargo Industry and also for personal use for tracking your vehicle or in the case of car-theft.</p></description>

				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Lightning Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>ExpressJS is one of the best NodeJS web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Lots of NodeJS developer use it as their main web application framework. They have their own coding-style for the application route and also its middleware.   Now, imagine if there are several backend engineers, developing a big web application and they never write any code documentation, only in several function/method. If there's a new engineer join the development, he/she has been given tasks by their lead engineer to enhance several endpoints and they don't know the flow of the endpoint. Hence, it will consume more time for new engineer to read other engineers code.  That's why PipaJS come to the rescue. PipaJS is a module for ExpressJS which will help developers to understand the flow of each route by just reading the route and its middleware flow.</p></description>

				<title> GoG(gas-o-gauge) - A smart IoT based solution for tracking fuel levels and Kitchen Intelligence</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Lightning Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Tracking fuel level in a gas cylinder is still an unexplored area where age old practices are followed to measure and track in developing countries like India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and many more. Gas-o-Gauge is an IoT based application which uses a Load sensor and a GPRS module in an embedded system to track and poll level of fuel to a server on cloud. It enables users and vendors to track and decide gas cylinder stock in a smart way.  With the increasing interconnection between people’s lives and the devices that they interact with in their daily lives, this IoT device is a scalable platform that allows users to integrate their daily kitchen needs and consumption to provide real time data for business intelligence to gas agencies and vendors as well as integrate daily requirements like ordering groceries, recipe trackers, restaurants listing during a low gas level as well as instructions and resources to drive/ride to the location. This prototype has been the runner up at the Indian School of Business, engineering design awards.

				<description><p>The talk will explain all about the project that I have done in the summer based on the enhancement of command line tools for sTeam collaboration platform and aware the people about the open source programming language called Pike. This will take the audience through the advantages/disadvantages to pick up this language as well as what difficulties(technical) I faced while learning this in a short time. This talk will also target the functioning of sTeam and how these "enhancements" were done (code wise) and the strategies applied to get it to work. Lastly, it will also encourage students to take up GSoC and Google code-in to boost their knowledge domain and be a part of the open source community.</p></description>

				<description><p>Many problems of recent interest in the banks are detection of fraud analysis as well as insurance analysis that can be put in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of fea- tures or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable.  H2O makes it possible for anyone to easily apply math and predictive analytics to solve today’s most challenging business problems. Combine the power of highly advanced algorithms, the freedom of open source, and the capacity of truly scalable in-memory processing for big data on one or many nodes. These capabilities make it faster, easier, and more cost effective to harness big data to maximum benefit for the business. Some Key features of using H2O are  Easy-to-use WebUI and Familiar Interfaces – Set up and get started quickly using either H2O’s intuitive Web-based user interface or familiar programming environ- ments like R, Java, Scala, Python, JSON, and through our powerful APIs. Massively Scalable Big Data Analysis – Train a model on complete data sets, not just small samples, and iterate and develop models in real-time with H2O’s rapid in-memory distributed parallel processing. Real-time Data Scoring – Use the Nanofast Scoring Engine to score data against models for accurate predictions in just nanoseconds in any environment. Enjoy 10X faster scoring.</p></description>

				<type>Lightning Talk</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>JSPM is the javascript package manager from future. It natively supports the new ES2015 module loader. When compared to other package managers like Browserify and Webpack, JSPM shines by supporting all the existing module loading configuration like commonJS, AMD, ES2015. It also allows to bundle the package for production, hence doing away with grunt, gulp or any other task runner. Under the hood it is powered by SystemJS to load the packages. Inside, it is nothing but a polyfill for the proposed ES2015 module loader, to make good use of the future javascript today. JSPM is going to be at the forefront of package/dependency management in the long run as hacks like minification and bundling soon become unnecessary in an attempt to make our web applications faster.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Spatial data mining is the process of discovering interesting, useful, non-trivial patterns from large spatial datasets.   A growing attention has been paid to spatial data mining and knowledge discovery (SDMKD). This paper presents the principles of SDMKD, proposes three new techniques, and gives their applicability and examples. First, the motivation of SDMKD is briefed. Second, the intension and extension of SDMKD concept are presented. Third, three new techniques are proposed in this section, i.e. SDMKD-based image classification that integrates spatial inductive learning from GIS database and Bayesian classification, cloud model that integrates randomness and fuzziness, data field that radiate the energy of observed data to the universe discourse. Fourth, applicability and examples are studied on three cases. The first is remote sensing classification, the second is landslide-monitoring data mining, and the third is uncertain reasoning. Finally, the whole paper is concluded and discussed.</p></description>

				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>The Node.JS &amp; npm ecosystem is oft praised for it's "culture of extreme modularity", which has led to the proliferation of hundreds of thousands packages on npm. How do modular patterns translate into the construction of evolving, real-world applications? Many functional programming learning resources will teach you to write functional code, but it's often highly indirect, deeply abstracted, requires understanding complex relationships between custom library calls, and doesn't represent the reality of how people actually write JavaScript. The goal of this workshop is to create realistic problems that can be solved using terse, vanilla, idiomatic JavaScript.</p></description>

				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>The OpenMRS platform and core modules are worked on by a central team of contributors who design and release these features through coordinated communication. But there are over 200 publicly available modules that have been developed to work on OpenMRS by over 500 different developers/organizations who maintain it without much coordination between themselves. There are modules that have moved between maintainers. Implementations of EHR systems have customized, release forks of modules in the true spirit of a bazaar model. There are over 25 projects that started in the OpenMRS community but have become their own companies, platforms, distributions that are used by implementers in over 50 countries. This fragmented community allows for freedom, but wastes resources, creates difficulties for new implementers and results in friction and dissatisfaction in the community. As central OpenMRS leadership, we have planned a certification process that will allow better management and governance of the community, but still improving the freedom of contributors to fork and establish smaller, specialized communities of practice.  The talk summarizes the historical divergence due to forks and communities of practice, by showing evolution of the community over last 10yrs. Later in the talk I discuss how the certification process brings visibility, coordination and accessibility to new members of the community.</p></description>

				<title>Free Communication with Free Software</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>At FOSDEM 2013, leading developers of free real-time communications software dared to get up on stage and ask the question "Can we replace Skype, Viber, Twitter and Facebook?". Was this the right question and how does it relate to free software development today and in the future? Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.  Can you imagine a world where phone communication works with all the benefits of email (but without spam)? Per-minute charges eliminated, flexibility for developers to customize the experience with standard scripting languages like Python or JavaScript and organizations of any size able to assert their identity and brand securely using SIP and XMPP addresses?  Is this a worthwhile vision? What do each of us - developers, sysadmins and end users - need to do to make it happen? What will be the alternative outcome - for both society in general and fans of free technology in particular - if we stand back and allow proprietary solutions to run rampant?  This session will survey some of the free software solutions that exist today and ways you can participate in their improvement and deployment to help realize this vision.</p></description>

				<description><p>Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve. To ease the pain, the second part of this workshop will *require* participants to have VirtualBox installed on their laptops.  The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software including the training of a deep network on simple problems.  This will be followed by a more in-depth portion : Using a pre-built VM, participants will experiment with a much larger pre-trained model, and get an understanding of application to both e-commerce and generative art.</p></description>

				<title>Build your own IoT Empire - From Games to MQTT and Back</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech Workshops</track>
				<type>Workshop of 2.5 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In this class, we are imagining that we have to build a new and fun product for our imaginary customer. It is supposed to be a gamification of the existing product. So we will learn how to attach an Espresso Lite board to an existing thing and turn it into an input or an output. We will show you how to network these things with each other, with a computer application (most likely a computer game), and your phone.  Bring some random not too valuable things (from your used coke can to some dollar store items) which you are not too sad about if they might get altered in a way that they might be not useful for unknown people anymore. We will provide aluminum foil, card stock, scissors, and glue for your alterations. Besides this bring a laptop, your team spirit, and lots of creativity.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>With over one billion devices activated, Android is an exciting space to make apps to help you communicate, organize, educate, entertain or anything else you’re passionate about.  Clearly there’s a demand for Android app development, and it’s turning the platform with the lovable green mascot into more and more of a strong first choice rather than just a secondary option.  So if you’ve been intent on, thinking about, or simply playing with the idea of learning Android… Make Your First Android App is here for you!  The session aims at introducing budding developers with the basic concepts and terminology in Android Development. It shall begin from scratch and discuss how to setup the environment and build a very own personal Android App with a Splash Screen for starters.</p></description>

				<description><p>Smart Guidance for blind: Shoes(can be replaced by some other way)  for the blind based on detecting obstructions and showing a path using sensors, cameras and principles of machine learning in Matlab using image processing: <a href="https://video-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xlp1/v/t42.3356-2/12662214_1716573171899154_409955334_n.mp4/video-1454345564.mp4?vabr=369772&amp;oh=ac6e29831a91c5c4eaed0e82b16af039&amp;oe=56B70EB1&amp;dl=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://video-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xlp1/v/t42.3356-2/12662214_1716573171899154_409955334_n.mp4/video-1454345564.mp4?vabr=369772&amp;oh=ac6e29831a91c5c4eaed0e82b16af039&amp;oe=56B70EB1&amp;dl=1</a>  We started working on this project three weeks back for Hackathon5.0 organized by Lakshya Foundation. Our main aim of this project is to give the total guidance for the blind.Have you all ever thought of the problems faced by the blind people? No will be the answer unless otherwise you are a blind.Even we didn't realise the problems  before starting our project.First we started with  listing down the problems faced by the blind people and then started finding the solutions for it. So we came up with the following problems. 1. Difficulty in finding the obstructions on their path. 2. Difficulty in reading the road signs and traffic <a href="http://signals.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">signals.So</a> they can't either drive or walk safely on the road. 3. Difficulty in reading the price <a href="http://tag.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tag.So</a> sellers can cheat them. 4. Difficulty in reading books.Since all the books are not translated to Braille letters.  5. Can't watch TV.   So we divided these problems into easy, advance and crazy to work on it.First we started working on the basic problems.The first solution we came up was using ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstructions.We created an app which is user friendly (blind person just have to tap) to give the voice <a href="http://output.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">output.So</a> we just fixed  3 ultra sonic sensors( per shoe front,back,left/right) and depending on the sensor output the voice will be given as output.Still we have problem in detecting in hanging obstructions and pits.We are trying to replace something with shoe which can fulfil all the conditions.Within a span of two weeks we have completed this task.Further we are working with image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to find the solutions for reading road signs(Image processing) and traffic signals(Colour recognition), reading books(Text to speech conversion) and finally for watching TV. As an engineer I suggest others also to work on the projects which would help the highly needed people. Because we never know the problems faced by the poor people and differently-able people. And they don't have enough knowledge or capability to work on their own problems.  ------------------------------------------   Problem Background: Corneal Blindness is one of the most common causes of blindness in India. India shoulders the largest burden of global blindness, about 3.5 million across the country with 30000 new cases being added each year. People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India, where living with disabilities can be especially challenging. Pedestrians are often forced off of side walks that are cluttered with vendors, animals and other obstacles. And because of the difficulty of moving independently, accessing services is also difficult. Blind people typically use canes, of course, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.   Problem Statement: The problem is now to provide them with an alternative guide to the cane, a guide with a more human like approach.  Proposed Solution: Our proposed solution is to develop shoes starting from the most basic level to a highly advanced AI version of those shoes. The steps are as follows: ⦁ Develop a model of shoes with 4 sensors for 4 different directions. These sensors can be distance or IR Led ones. A microcontroller interface would be in place to transmit voice messages through a communications module to the headset of the person wearing the shoes. ⦁ In the intermediate stage the model would contain 4 cameras instead of sensors. The camera’s working on basic image processing would be able to make out textures, landscapes and obstructions to a degree as defined by the manufacturer. ⦁ The final stage would involve trying to get the shoes to define the situations it are placed in by themselves using image processing and machine learning.  End users: The blind people around the world. Since our final product doesn't make use of smart/mobile phone, the person who can use it need not be aware of it. The output will be given as sound through headsets. Devices: Shoes, 4 cameras, 4 sensors,  headset, a micro controller and other electronic components Platforms, Technologies to be used: Machine learning in Matlab using image processing, interfacing camera, sensor and headset Data set, tools, resources useful in developing solution: Can choose any image processing tools and other technologies.</p></description>

				<title>Building an open-source satellite tracker to talk via satellites</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Hardware and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Satellite communication is moderately difficult. It can be achieved with handheld antennas but (a) this is more difficult than it needs to be and (b) this limits your ability to communicate in marginal conditions. Building a rotator/elevator that is capable of automatically tracking a satellite across the sky frees up one hand which simplifies the process and increases pointing precision, meaning that you're better able to communicate in marginal conditions than you would be with a handheld antenna. In this talk I'll describe my build of the "Tricked-Out WRAPS" system and, if we're really lucky, demonstrate it live.</p></description>

				<description><p>Tizen is an open source operating system for consumer electronics such as Mobile, Wearables, TVs, Vehicles, Cameras, the world of IoT &amp; much more. It is heavily supported and worked on today by Samsung Electronics and community. It has already shipped several million products and is expanding. The goal is for it to be a real community effort between OEMs and all other interested parties to have a truly free and open operating system that can be used to develop products without restrictions.  This will introduce what Tizen is, some of its history and where it is going, but will try and aim to be more of an interactive session to answer questions and gather feedback.  Bring your curiosity and positivity and perhaps we can all build a better future for our gadgets together.</p></description>

				<title>Project Zygote - Lego for the Internet of Things</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Hardware and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Over the past one year, me and my teammate worked on developing a rapid prototyping framework for the Internet of Things. Repository can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/kres/zygote" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/kres/zygote</a> The idea was to make IoT development as simple as Lego, i.e. connecting blocks to build a system. In this case the system is made out of sensors, actuators and are connected to the cloud. The user visualizes all the sensor and actuator endpoints as simple building blocks on the browser. Interconnecting these blocks virtually on the browser creates a actual data flow in the real world (basically over the air configuration of all sensors and actuators). The user can then add triggers, events, timers, filters to the flow to create more complex IoT systems.  The top three highlights of the framework: * Setting up the IoT application can be completely visual. i.e. no programming required. (But code can be added if the user wants to) * The system can work over any wired/wireless medium - like bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, etc. * The framework is platform neutral. Though it is been developed on the Beaglebone Black, it will run fine on Raspberry Pi, Cubie board, etc. Not limited by the hardware.  During the proposed talk I will be talking about design and implementation of the project including the challenges we faced, sample application and future work. This work was presented at an International IEEE conference held in IIT Madras earlier this year.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Recently the applications of radioactivity in the industry and medical fields are on the rise but the education in this area has not shown any progress. Nuclear physics experiments are included in undergraduate and graduate Physics syllabus  of many Indian universities. However, the required facilities are scarce due to high cost of the equipment and difficulties in obtaining radioactive sources.  To provide an effective solution to this problem Phoenix project of IUAC, New Delhi (<a href="http://www.iuac.res.in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.iuac.res.in</a>) has developed some open source set-ups for nuclear physics experiments. In this presentation we will be discussing about Alpha Spectrometer, Multi Channel Analyser Radiation Detection System and USB Geiger Müller Counter. All the development is open sourced and major part of the software is written in python.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>By using GPIO to connect the Raspberry Pi to a circuit board, the LEDs and buzzer on the board can be controlled with Python code to make a simple memory game of repeating a pattern. The Raspberry Pi and circuit components are relatively inexpensive, making it a good project for students who want to learn more about hardware and circuitry, and see a physical manifestation of how software can interface with hardware. In the talk, we will go though both the hardware and software aspects of using GPIO, as well as how the project can be further enhanced for other practical IoT purposes.</p></description>

				<description><p>Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. We can use it to build the infrastructure in many cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, GoogleCloud, Docker, OpenStack etc. Moreover it has an provisioners like chef, which we can use to automate for configuration Management. It can be seen as similar to cloud-formation from AWS. Within this short workshop with  this tool I am creating a basic two-tier  infrastructure stack in a single command. What I will do it in one stroke of command is Create a complete infrastructure in AWS VPC running an app server, What are the things happening in this one command:  - Creating a VPC. - Creating a subnets one public and private. - Creating respective security groups and rules. - Creating a load balancer. - Creating a app server running an web server called nginx. - Attaching a server to ELB and giving us a public DNS by which we can access the app. - And it gives a simple sketch diagram of our infrastructure as well. Thus we have full fledged app running on Cloud in single Command.

				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Businesses demand fast paced development of highly scalable, web centric applications. This puts lot of pressure on developers and then scalability, higher throughput, UI etc becomes their focus points. At the same time DBA &amp; Ops team too are accountable for robustness and performance. Both the teams approach same applications with different perspective and it creates some challenges. For example while DBA team is concerned about consistency of data, developers are more often concerned about ease of development.   How do we address these challenges and work together. As a DB Architect for a solutions company I have been interacting with various customer’s development teams and getting to know their views on how they use databases. In the process, I have shared some inputs with them which they have found quite useful and in turn I have picked up a few tips from them.   During my presentation I would like to share about 7 such important lessons that should be pinned to every developer’s and data architect’s desk while developing a web-scale app. These tips are about improvement in the application design and architecture but they come from a Database Architect’s perspective. To illustrate these tips I would be using popular features of an open source database – PostgreSQL.</p></description>

				<title>Let Builder write the Jenkins Jobs (JJB)</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>DevOps</track>
				<type>Workshop of 1 hour</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Jenkins easily allows you to build and test your projects continuously. But creating similar Jenkins jobs could be mundane sometimes, how about automating that part with Jenkins Job Builder by writing JJB configuration files for creating a number of Jenkins Jobs at once. One can keep job descriptions in human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and auditing easier. Creating a bunch of similarly configured jobs is also easy with templating. In this workshop, I 'll start with a brief introduction to Jenkins (if required) and Jenkins Job Builder. We shall do a hands-on session with writing JJB configuration files and see how the jobs are created in jenkins, how can we create multiple jobs and manage them.</p></description>

				<description><p>What if you could “file a bug on the internet” in a public space where developers, users and browser vendors could be made aware of compatibility issues? You can report issues to browser vendors today, through bug trackers or other feedback mechanisms, some public and some not. But frequently you cannot see the results of such a report—or see what related issues others have reported. It can feel like a black hole experience. This talk is about introduction to <a href="http://webcompat.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">webcompat.com</a>, where we provide simple, open interface to web compatibility issues that affect us all as users of the web, regardless of our browsers or devices of choice. Perhaps more importantly, we hope to foster and enable a community of people who are passionate about a web for everyone to help out.</p></description>

				<description><p>Is there any credible way to build a trustworthy communications platform without using free software?  At FOSDEM 2013, leading developers of free real-time communications software dared to get up on stage and ask the question "Can we replace Skype, Viber, Twitter and Facebook?". Was this the right question and how does it relate to free software development today and in the future? Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.</p></description>

				<title>Introduction to GraphQL (or How I Learned To Stop Worrying about REST APIs)</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>WebTech</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>This talk will give a brief and enlightening look into how GraphQL can help you address common weaknesses that you, as a web / mobile developer, would normally face with using / building typical REST API systems.  Let's stop fighting about whether we should implement the strictest interpretation of REST or how pragmatic REST-ful design is the only way to go, or debate about what REST is or what it should be.  A couple of demos (In Golang! Yay!) will be shown that are guaranteed to open up your eyes and see that the dawn of liberation for product developers is finally here.  Background: GraphQL is a data query language and runtime designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps since 2012.  Hafiz Ismail (@sogko) is an active contributor to Go / Golang implementation of GraphQL server library (<a href="https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql</a>) and is looking to encourage fellow developers to join in the collaborative effort.</p></description>

				<description><p>Test driven development (TDD) is a very useful software development strategy, but it is not yet taught and practiced as widely as it should. Learning TDD practice in Python can be challenging because there are several "competing" packages without an obvious "best way" to do it. Simplicity and readability are core concepts of Python, and in this talk I will try to show how it can be applied to testing by doing a side-by-side comparison of unittest/selenium vs pytest/splinter in a simple web application development context.</p></description>

My talk will divided into 2-3 minutes chunks, where I would be talking about architecture, functionality of various projects (pagure, fmn, bodhi etc) within the Fedora Infrastructure. My primary focus would to enlighten the participants on how this various applications interact within themselves so that the contributors can visualize the infrastructure as a whole. I also intent to speak on Federated Message Bus (fedmsg) within the infra through which the message passing takes place.  At the end of the talk I plan to tell them on how to pick their first bug and the communication channels through which they can contact the Fedora upstream.</p></description>

				<track>Python</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Tunir is CI made for developers in mind. It is very simple and easy to configure. Each job only takes a json file, and .txt file as configuration.   It can boot up cloud image on any laptop/server or can use Vagrant images to test any project. One of the latest feature is about testing on AWS EC2 instances. For any given AMI &amp; authentication details, it can spin up the instance, and execute the tests on it.  Currently Fedora Project is using tunir to automatically test its own cloud, atomic, and Vagrant images. We write the test cases using Python 3 unittest module. The documentation of the project can be found at <a href="https://tunir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tunir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a></p></description>

				<description><p>Understanding of basic concepts in science, math and technology is the most important thing in every students life. But sometimes science lectures aren't just boring, they are ineffective too and result in loss of interest among students. Learning science can be fun if we could visualize the concepts and relate them with the real world. Python programming language has the potential to change a dull teaching learning process in to more stimulating active learning. Equations in physics and maths always look dull and boring. With the power of python one can see the beauty behind those equations and can find real world connections. With the effective use of python programs a  teacher can actively engage the students and help them visualize the concepts and have better understanding. In this presentation I will talk about my teaching experiments with Python in Physics with live demo of some scientific python programs.</p></description>

				<title>ircb - A versatile, scalable IRC Bouncer, as a service, for humans</title>

				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>ircb1 is a IRC Bouncer as a service, made for humans. It's currently functional as a basic IRC bouncer, however, unlike mainstream IRC bouncers, it supports multiple client connections for the same IRC network connection for a user. It aims to provide a scalable bouncer service along with easy setup, deployment and management. It also envisions to provide a low barrier entry point for users, where users can join and start using the service in an automated fashion, without going through manual processes.  Although, ircb is a standalone product, it is also one of the core components of waartaa2. waartaa is our attempt to create an open source SAAS communication and collaboration tool, around IRC. We also participated in GSoC under the Fedora umbrella. However, we hit various roadblocks with the initial code base given to it's monolithic structure. So, we started breaking down the app into micro services. Thus, ircb, the scalable IRC bouncer to empower waartaa, was born.  IRC networks limit the number of connections for an IP, and this limit has to be manually negotiated, and the process takes time. We came to know of this during maintaining a demo instance of waartaa on a single node, when Freenode will stop rejecting IRC connections from our IP. That's why we are looking forward to have a multi node model for ircb, where we can intelligently distribute the IRC network connections, as needed. We are also brainstorming to figure out an intelligent way to load balance connections from IRC clients to the bouncer service in a stateless fashion. You can find some insight about it in our initial design docs3. We are also trying to develop a reactive store layer to empower realtime applications, in our case, waartaa.</p></description>

				<description><p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) assists with the creation and  distribution of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in support of humanitarian relief efforts. OSM is the Free Wiki World Map – an openly licensed map of the world being created by volunteers using local knowledge, GPS tracks and donated sources.   One of the online tools developed by HOT to assist this effort is the Export Tool, which creates custom OSM downloads in a number of file formats for various regions around the world. The user can simply choose an area of geographic interest, select the OSM features they wish to export and specify a file format. This export can then be used on a variety of GIS tools such as ArcMap, QGIS, Google Earth, the OsmAnd mobile app and the Garmin GPS device.   The ability to easily obtain updated OSM data can greatly contribute to relief efforts on the ground, as well as being used for personal interests, business ventures and research purposes. In the case of the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal in April 2015, post-disaster road and building data from OSM was used to manoeuvre people and supplies to where they were most needed.</p></description>

				<title>Migration from Oracle to PostgreSQL - The problems and the solutions -</title>

				<type>Talk of 45 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In recent years, the applicable enterprise area of PostgreSQL has been significantly enlarged by performance and functionality enhancement.  As a result, there is a emerging demand to migrate database systems to PostgreSQL from Oracle. In this presentation, we will report on the following two tools which greatly help our migration projects: * SQL Imcompatibility detection tool (db_syntax_diff) * Oracle emulating function libraries "orafce" and our enhancement   We are working at the open source software center (OSS center) at NTT which is the largest telecommunications company group in Japan. For the purpose of software cost reduction, we have been carried out a lot of database migration projects so far.   Most of our customers are preferring so called "DB migration project", in which only the middle-ware DBMS will be replaced and AP itself will be reused. This is because such projects are usually considered more effective in terms of development time and cost than the "rebuild" projects, in which the system will be build again from scratch.  Nevertheless, the differences between old and new DBMSs often block the migration projects technically, and considerable number of projects may be giving up eventually. We found the major factors that make the migration difficult is following two:   * Cost of the estimation work   * Technical difficulty of the estimation work itself   As a solution of these problems, we have developed a non-compatible SQL auto-detection tool named db_syntax_diff. This tool can extract PostgreSQL incompatible SQLs in AP for Oracle and append each of them a difficulty index for migration. We've performed more than 30 database migration projects using this tool.   As another effort to solve migration problems, we are also working on function enhancement of orafce (Oracle emulation libraries). Based on the knowledge of frequently seen incompatibilities in the above estimations, we have added a large number of new entries to the orafce.</p></description>

				<description><p>Upwork is the world’s largest freelance talent marketplace, with 10+MM freelancers and 4+MM clients, and pays out more than $1+B annually in salaries. The data processing pipeline at Upwork consists of PG production DB, GPDB data warehouse, and multiple Vitesse DB data marts. I will detail the distinctive role of each system, and provide details on the setup of the pipeline, specifically how data flow from production to DW to data mart. If time permits, I will also give some examples of how the platform works for the data scientists at Upwork.</p></description>

Simply switching your data warehouse or data mart from SQL Server or Oracle could save your organisation hundreds of thousands of dollars.    In this session we will explore features that make PostgreSQL a great DW solution, with a mix of presentation and demonstration. By the time the session ends, you will understand the technical and business benefits of PostgreSQL, as well as some cool integration tips for your first project.</p></description>

				<description><p>In this talk I will talk about doing KNN (nearest neighbor) search in Postgres with PostGIS and ordering the result based on more than just physical distance. This ordering is the core of the dating app Tantan, which I will use to illustrate the talk.      At Tantan we have more than one million users every day that look through 200 million potential matches each day, and we need to optimize what we show to maximize the potential chance for a match. We do that by ordering the potential matches based on a number of criteria, such as distance from you, recent activity and popularity.</p></description>

				<title>Ensuring Patent Non-Aggression in Linux and OSS Projects</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Internet, Society, Community</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In an era increasingly marked by project-based innovation, the modality that Open Source has ushered in is creating unprecedented levels of innovation.  As participants in global projects build upon each others ideas and inventions to be able to innovate in an iterative manner, a culture of co-opetition is emerging which allows companies to successfully collaborate and compete at the same time.   As part of this evolution from silo'd invention inside individual companies to collaborative project-based innovation, a parallel culture of patent non-aggression has developed through the creation of the Open Invention Network (OIN) which over the last 10 years has grown into the largest patent non-aggression community in the history of technology.     Keeping pace with the growth and proliferation of Linux and other OSS-based platforms into key markets such as mobile, home, auto and finance, OIN has doubled in size twice over the past 36 months and now is a community of over 2,000 entities and individuals explicitly committed to patent non-aggression in core technologies that enable innovation in these new markets/sectors.   The how and why of OIN's successful expansion and the benefits of participation in this free community will be discussed.</p></description>

				<description><p>Software patent, a pdf file containing large amount of texts, piles of sections, drawings. Software Patents turns out to be very difficult and vague to many of the developers. In this talk we will go through a software patent, and try to identify the key parts and the legal aspect of the same. Intellectual Property and different kinds of the same. When one can acquire different types of intellectual property rights at the same time for the different parts of the same property.  * Face of a patent (the metadata legal department cares a lot about) * Inventor, and inventorship * Can we destroy a patent? (Hint: talk to the owner) * Synopsis of the Patent * Title, abstract, and figures * The thick part (the body of the patent, or as we call it "specification") * The claims (Heart of the patent) * Indentation :) Unless and until a software patent is tested, in a court of law, by running of it, it is impossible to say if something matches with the claim of the patent or not. At the end of the talk we will go through various other resources which one can visit from where one can learn more.</p></description>

				<description><p>As a student, we want to raise the awareness of using open source software online for free. The environment of using the open source software in Taiwan is monopolized by expensive software, such as Microsoft series, Adobe and Photoshop. People seldom get a chance to realize that they actually have easy access to resources online which is free and much more convenient. Moreover, most of the budget of our country is used to buy the copyrights of software packages, but in practice we only use the basic functions of them. Simply put, we waste a lot of money buying something which is unnecessary. We discover it is the language barrier that makes people in Taiwan less likely to use open source software programs. Getting the deeper understanding of the serious problem we faced with, we come up with some solutions. Using big data to analyze vocabularies which are used frequently, we gather the information to indicate language barriers. Moreover, we can list out all the words which is hard for people, so that engineers can use the software and check the vocabularies at the same time. By using methods to remember the vocabularies, engineers can easily use the software. We can even use big data to analyze the steps which are used frequently and visualize them as a report. Like, we make a brief introduction to summarize the basic functions. So people only need to recognize the steps and check it through the introduction when they need. We launch a workshop to teach them step by step in English how to use the open source software. By enhancing engineers’ English ability, now we can create a community to start influencing the general public. We create a community to overcome the language barrier and to change the habits of Taiwanese for using software. We start from NCKU and share with other schools. We create a platform for sharing the information of updated software. By translating the information from the internet like <a href="http://opensource.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">opensource.com</a>, we provide not only the materials for target group, but also chances to the general public to know the advantages of open source software.  On the other hand, we translate the video of “opensoucephysics” to use the materials in our education system. By using the interesting videos and materials, teachers can inspire students to think outside the box and use their imagination to understand some difficult science concepts in classes. Furthermore, we can integrate the education materials with “ezgo” and provide a chance for students to begin self-learning. We use three main methods to promote the use of open source software. First, we are going to launch a program which is composed of different schools such as NCKU, NCTU and NTU to create an engineering social media. Second, we cooperate with the professors and schools to open a course to invite students to join our translating program. Third, we create a social media and launch “hour of translate” and invite friends to join us. Furthermore, we cooperate with the summer and winter camps to share our passion for open source software. To promote our ideas, we submit the application to teach for classes in other level of schools, such as elementary schools, junior schools and high schools.  It is necessary a waste that we seldom make the most of free resources online. We spend a lot of budget buying the software which is replaceable and deal with problems in an ineffective way. That is why we start this project to help others in an efficient way.</p></description>

We are using digital tools to preserve the heritage sites being actively deleted by ISIS. * A Cultural Development project, hosting live workshops and building a network of artists, technologists, archaeologists, architects, and others to research, construct models, and create artistic works. * A Curatorial project, creating exhibitions and experiences in museums and institutions globally, celebrating the cultural heritage of Syria and the world through the lens of architecture embodying culture and power.  Together with our international affiliates, #NEWPALMYRA sources archaeological and historical data, shares it with the community, and outputs art exhibitions, salons, and creative works using this data to carry the rich history of Palmyra forward to new generations.</p></description>

				<description><p>It is possible to create and make your own PCB without the use of dangerous chemicals. Simply by using Vineger, Hydrogen Peroxide and Salt you are able to make fairly complex PCB boards. The process is simple and fast and gives you the flexibility to make 1 single board or multiple different prototype boards for testing.  This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board.</p></description>

				<description><p>This presentation is about the Sensor Plug-ins developed for ExpEYES : Pocket Science Lab as a part of my GSoC-2015 project with FOSSASIA.  We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc.  With this development we at FOSSASIA  are aiming to  provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world.  I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everyday…..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.</p></description>

				<description><p>“The Other Nefertiti” is an artistic intervention by Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al- Badri which went viral. “With the data leak as a part of this counter narrative within our investigative practice we want to activate the artefact, to inspire a critical re-assessment of today’s conditions and to overcome the colonial notion of possession in Germany's museums”. With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the “Global North“ deals with heritage and the representation of “the Other”. “We should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.“ At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain: <a href="http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>  Here is the video showing the scanning process: <a href="https://vimeo.com/148156899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  “The Other Nefertiti”  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing “The Other” always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .</p></description>

				<description><p>“The Other Nefertiti” is an artistic intervention by Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al- Badri which went viral. “With the data leak as a part of this counter narrative within our investigative practice we want to activate the artefact, to inspire a critical re-assessment of today’s conditions and to overcome the colonial notion of possession in Germany's museums”. With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the “Global North“ deals with heritage and the representation of “the Other”. “We should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.“   At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain:  <a href="http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>   Here is the video showing the scanning process:  <a href="https://vimeo.com/148156899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  “The Other Nefertiti”  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing “The Other” always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .</p></description>

				<description><p>Smart Guidance for blind: Shoes(can be replaced by some other way)  for the blind based on detecting obstructions and showing a path using sensors, cameras and principles of machine learning in Matlab using image processing: <a href="https://video-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xlp1/v/t42.3356-2/12662214_1716573171899154_409955334_n.mp4/video-1454345564.mp4?vabr=369772&amp;oh=ac6e29831a91c5c4eaed0e82b16af039&amp;oe=56B70EB1&amp;dl=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://video-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xlp1/v/t42.3356-2/12662214_1716573171899154_409955334_n.mp4/video-1454345564.mp4?vabr=369772&amp;oh=ac6e29831a91c5c4eaed0e82b16af039&amp;oe=56B70EB1&amp;dl=1</a>  We started working on this project three weeks back for Hackathon5.0 organized by Lakshya Foundation. Our main aim of this project is to give the total guidance for the blind.Have you all ever thought of the problems faced by the blind people? No will be the answer unless otherwise you are a blind.Even we didn't realise the problems  before starting our project.First we started with  listing down the problems faced by the blind people and then started finding the solutions for it. So we came up with the following problems. 1. Difficulty in finding the obstructions on their path. 2. Difficulty in reading the road signs and traffic <a href="http://signals.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">signals.So</a> they can't either drive or walk safely on the road. 3. Difficulty in reading the price <a href="http://tag.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tag.So</a> sellers can cheat them. 4. Difficulty in reading books.Since all the books are not translated to Braille letters.  5. Can't watch TV.   So we divided these problems into easy, advance and crazy to work on it.First we started working on the basic problems.The first solution we came up was using ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstructions.We created an app which is user friendly (blind person just have to tap) to give the voice <a href="http://output.So" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">output.So</a> we just fixed  3 ultra sonic sensors( per shoe front,back,left/right) and depending on the sensor output the voice will be given as output.Still we have problem in detecting in hanging obstructions and pits.We are trying to replace something with shoe which can fulfil all the conditions.Within a span of two weeks we have completed this task.Further we are working with image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to find the solutions for reading road signs(Image processing) and traffic signals(Colour recognition), reading books(Text to speech conversion) and finally for watching TV. As an engineer I suggest others also to work on the projects which would help the highly needed people. Because we never know the problems faced by the poor people and differently-able people. And they don't have enough knowledge or capability to work on their own problems.  ------------------------------------------   Problem Background: Corneal Blindness is one of the most common causes of blindness in India. India shoulders the largest burden of global blindness, about 3.5 million across the country with 30000 new cases being added each year. People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India, where living with disabilities can be especially challenging. Pedestrians are often forced off of side walks that are cluttered with vendors, animals and other obstacles. And because of the difficulty of moving independently, accessing services is also difficult. Blind people typically use canes, of course, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.   Problem Statement: The problem is now to provide them with an alternative guide to the cane, a guide with a more human like approach.  Proposed Solution: Our proposed solution is to develop shoes starting from the most basic level to a highly advanced AI version of those shoes. The steps are as follows: ⦁ Develop a model of shoes with 4 sensors for 4 different directions. These sensors can be distance or IR Led ones. A microcontroller interface would be in place to transmit voice messages through a communications module to the headset of the person wearing the shoes. ⦁ In the intermediate stage the model would contain 4 cameras instead of sensors. The camera’s working on basic image processing would be able to make out textures, landscapes and obstructions to a degree as defined by the manufacturer. ⦁ The final stage would involve trying to get the shoes to define the situations it are placed in by themselves using image processing and machine learning.  End users: The blind people around the world. Since our final product doesn't make use of smart/mobile phone, the person who can use it need not be aware of it. The output will be given as sound through headsets. Devices: Shoes, 4 cameras, 4 sensors,  headset, a micro controller and other electronic components Platforms, Technologies to be used: Machine learning in Matlab using image processing, interfacing camera, sensor and headset Data set, tools, resources useful in developing solution: Can choose any image processing tools and other technologies.</p></description>

				<description><p>I'm going to give an overview about the machine tool industry and how manufacturing takes place at a scale. I'm going to give details about the processes and the machines used to achieve production at that scale. I'll also discuss some popular case studies like Foxconn manufacturing line for Apple. It will be insightful for start-ups to understand the the ecosystem and challenges when you manufacture at scale and the challenges to bring a product from a prototype to production stage.</p></description>

It can be achieved with handheld antennas but (a) this is more difficult than it needs to be and (b) this limits your ability to communicate in marginal conditions. Building a rotator/elevator that is capable of automatically tracking a satellite across the sky frees up one hand which simplifies the process and increases pointing precision, meaning that you're better able to communicate in marginal conditions than you would be with a handheld antenna. In this talk I'll describe my build of the "Tricked-Out WRAPS" system and, if we're really lucky, demonstrate it live.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Tizen is an open source operating system for consumer electronics such as Mobile, Wearables, TVs, Vehicles, Cameras, the world of IoT &amp; much more. It is heavily supported and worked on today by Samsung Electronics and community. It has already shipped several million products and is expanding. The goal is for it to be a real community effort between OEMs and all other interested parties to have a truly free and open operating system that can be used to develop products without restrictions.  This will introduce what Tizen is, some of its history and where it is going, but will try and aim to be more of an interactive session to answer questions and gather feedback.  Bring your curiosity and positivity and perhaps we can all build a better future for our gadgets together.</p></description>

				<title>Project Zygote - Lego for the Internet of Things</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Hardware and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Over the past one year, me and my teammate worked on developing a rapid prototyping framework for the Internet of Things. Repository can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/kres/zygote" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/kres/zygote</a> The idea was to make IoT development as simple as Lego, i.e. connecting blocks to build a system. In this case the system is made out of sensors, actuators and are connected to the cloud. The user visualizes all the sensor and actuator endpoints as simple building blocks on the browser. Interconnecting these blocks virtually on the browser creates a actual data flow in the real world (basically over the air configuration of all sensors and actuators). The user can then add triggers, events, timers, filters to the flow to create more complex IoT systems.  The top three highlights of the framework: * Setting up the IoT application can be completely visual. i.e. no programming required. (But code can be added if the user wants to) * The system can work over any wired/wireless medium - like bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, etc. * The framework is platform neutral. Though it is been developed on the Beaglebone Black, it will run fine on Raspberry Pi, Cubie board, etc. Not limited by the hardware.  During the proposed talk I will be talking about design and implementation of the project including the challenges we faced, sample application and future work. This work was presented at an International IEEE conference held in IIT Madras earlier this year.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Recently the applications of radioactivity in the industry and medical fields are on the rise but the education in this area has not shown any progress. Nuclear physics experiments are included in undergraduate and graduate Physics syllabus  of many Indian universities. However, the required facilities are scarce due to high cost of the equipment and difficulties in obtaining radioactive sources.  To provide an effective solution to this problem Phoenix project of IUAC, New Delhi (<a href="http://www.iuac.res.in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.iuac.res.in</a>) has developed some open source set-ups for nuclear physics experiments. In this presentation we will be discussing about Alpha Spectrometer, Multi Channel Analyser Radiation Detection System and USB Geiger Müller Counter. All the development is open sourced and major part of the software is written in python.</p></description>

				<track>Hardware and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>By using GPIO to connect the Raspberry Pi to a circuit board, the LEDs and buzzer on the board can be controlled with Python code to make a simple memory game of repeating a pattern. The Raspberry Pi and circuit components are relatively inexpensive, making it a good project for students who want to learn more about hardware and circuitry, and see a physical manifestation of how software can interface with hardware. In the talk, we will go though both the hardware and software aspects of using GPIO, as well as how the project can be further enhanced for other practical IoT purposes.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Ring, a project from Savoir-faire Linux, creators of SFLphone, uses a distributed hash table instead of a central SIP server to find other users. This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's OpenDHT library.  Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.</p></description>

Unlike physical communication, we cannot control who can reach our data when we send it through the "inter-tubes." Fortunately, there are techniques to prevent people from eavesdropping your online conversations. In this workshop, I will talk about easy-to-use security tools that you can use to keep your conversations private: how to encrypt emails and instant messaging. It will be a not-so-technical workshop aimed to include anybody who knows how to use email.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>According to a Forrester Research in 2014, smartphone penetration across the Asia Pacific region will reach 36 percent of the entire population in 2015. With higher smartphone penetration, the number of mobile apps , also increases at an alarming rate. This heats up the pressure on individual mobile developers to find ways to stand out from the crowd and generate revenues. While a great app is a good start, developers who wants to build a serious business also need a solid monetization strategy.</p></description>

				<description><p>This is a lead up talk for the Creative Confidence Innovation depends on developing creative solutions for the complicated challenges we will be facing, but what happens if we want to start innovating but we believe that we are not creative? During this talk I will share some of the lessons I've learned along the way and how Making helped me increase my creative confidence and how others could increase theirs. The talk will gravitate around 3 key points: Breaking free from the "I'm not creative mentality". What would happen if we all increase our creative confidence?</p></description>

				<title>QA in the Open</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech and IoT</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>One common misconception about a lot of Open Source projects is that the quality is variable and/or is of a secondary concern. This is supported to a certain degree by a lot of projects which do minimal testing upstream and rely on downstream consumers, vendors, or distros to do an additional set of testing after a release. But, there is no reason that an open project can not also do QA in the open as part of the community.   While the term QA will likely evoke a combination of fear, disdain, or any of a plethora of negative emotions from anyone who has worked in a traditional enterprise development environment and probably scare them off. The top down approach, strict bureaucracy, and other issues which are often synonymous with QA teams doesn't have to be the case. There can be real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an open source project. It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to consumers the stability of a project. Larger projects can especially reap a lot of benefit from having people working on the QA side of a project upstream.  This talk will use OpenStack as an case study to explore how a large open source project can do QA in an open manner and the potential benefits it can provide. It'll cover how the OpenStack community does QA, how it's evolved over time, and share lessons of some best practices which have been learned over time.</p></description>

				<description><p>Scientific Data is in general freely available. This applies also to experimental data in chemical / biological research. There is however often a barrier preventing the re-use and re-analysis of obtained raw data due to expensive proprietary instrument software. In the field of Imaging Mass Spectrometry, we started an open source project to solve this problem. The project is now hosted on <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.bioconductor.org</a>, a large repository for open source life science software in the programming language R.</p></description>

				<description><p>Distributed teams are a necessity in today's globally connected environment. No longer are our customers, people, and offices all locally located. In fact, they might not even be on the same continent much less the same side of the world. To promote a healthy environment and ensure clients and products are getting the results needed, sustainable management of distributed teams is a requirement. This presentation will cover the understanding for forming, storming, norming, and performing of remote teams.</p></description>

				<description><p>It is possible to create and make your own PCB without the use of dangerous chemicals. Simply by using Vineger, Hydrogen Peroxide and Salt you are able to make fairly complex PCB boards. The process is simple and fast and gives you the flexibility to make 1 single board or multiple different prototype boards for testing.  This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board.</p></description>

				<description><p>This presentation is about the Sensor Plug-ins developed for ExpEYES : Pocket Science Lab as a part of my GSoC-2015 project with FOSSASIA.  We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc.  With this development we at FOSSASIA  are aiming to  provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world.  I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everyday…..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.</p></description>

				<description><p>“The Other Nefertiti” is an artistic intervention by Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al- Badri which went viral. “With the data leak as a part of this counter narrative within our investigative practice we want to activate the artefact, to inspire a critical re-assessment of today’s conditions and to overcome the colonial notion of possession in Germany's museums”. With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the “Global North“ deals with heritage and the representation of “the Other”. “We should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.“ At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain: <a href="http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>  Here is the video showing the scanning process: <a href="https://vimeo.com/148156899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  “The Other Nefertiti”  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing “The Other” always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .</p></description>

				<title>Building Truly Native Apps with NativeScript</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>OpenTech Workshops</track>
				<type>Workshop of 1.5 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>We are going to explore the vast galaxy of native app development, but not on iOS, Android or Windows. But on the very familiar JavaScript framework. NativeScript is fully open sourced, so developers now have an option to build truly native mobile applications without the need to code in many different languages. We will get some hands on during this workshop to play with NativeScript and explore some of its amazing capabilities.</p></description>

				<type>Workshop of 1 hour</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>You can control devices in your home from your computer with no new wiring. This session covers controlling lights, bells, and motors using open source software. Wireless remotes can also control devices. Sensors can provide information about motion, sunset, temperature. Capturing caller id and auto-dialing is also covered. X10 is an ideal system for home automation, and there are methods to improve reliability. Computers can easily send X10 signals across your electrical network. The session concludes with a live demo showing a home with 38 computer-controlled devices and sensors.

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Pocket Science Lab is yet another ambitious project from FOSSASIA  with the objective to develop open source hardware and software technology to improve science education by changing the way we teach and learn. PSL@FOSSASIA   aims to deliver low-cost lab equipments to millions of students and young scientists and enable them to learn science by experimenting and exploring.  The main components of PSL are  ExpEYES: Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists [1] and MicroHope: Micro-controllers for Hobby Projects and Education [2] , projects by Dr. Ajith Kumar B P of IUAC, New Delhi [3].  ExpEYES is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments, classroom demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a portable science laboratory.   In this workshop participants will be able to do hands-on science experiments  covering various concepts like electricity, electromagnetic induction, sound, interference, oscillations etc...  This workshop is for kids of any age [10 to 100 years :) ] who are interested in science hacks :)  [1] ExpEYES: <a href="http://www.expeyes.in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.expeyes.in</a>  [2] MicroHope:  <a href="http://www.microhope.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.microhope.org</a> [3] IUAC:  <a href="http://iuac.res.in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://iuac.res.in/</a> [4] PSL: <a href="http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/</a></p></description>

				<title>Physical Open Source  Gaming - How to Build Your own Customized Game Controller for Multiplayer Fun</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Tech Kids II</track>
				<type>Workshop of 4 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In this workshop, we will show you our own special twist on the Internet of Things. Using an Espresso Lite (that's no coffee - this is actually a little computer with wifi) we will turn some household goods and some wire into your own multiplayer game controller. You will learn a lot about electronics, networking, and how much fun it is to build an open source community when we explore some of the open source projects, who enabled me to build the software for these controllers. And of course, we will play at least one fun open source multiplayer game with our own controllers in the end of the class. I will also point you to many other open source game projects you can adapt to use your new customized game controller with the knowledge of this class.  Bring some basic computer literacy (no programming required but it helps to dig deeper), some curiosity, a laptop, team spirit, and the willingness to do some crafting (yes there will be scissors and glue).</p></description>

				<type>Workshop of 2 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Pocket Science Lab is yet another ambitious project from FOSSASIA  with the objective to develop open source hardware and software technology to improve science education by changing the way we teach and learn. PSL@FOSSASIA   aims to deliver low-cost lab equipments to millions of students and young scientists and enable them to learn science by experimenting and exploring.  The main components of PSL are  ExpEYES: Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists [1] and MicroHope: Micro-controllers for Hobby Projects and Education [2] , projects by Dr. Ajith Kumar B P of IUAC, New Delhi [3].  ExpEYES is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments, classroom demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a portable science laboratory.   In this workshop participants will be able to do hands-on science experiments  covering various concepts like electricity, electromagnetic induction, sound, interference, oscillations etc...  This workshop is for kids of any age [10 to 100 years :) ] who are interested in science hacks :)  [1] ExpEYES: <a href="http://www.expeyes.in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.expeyes.in</a>  [2] MicroHope:  <a href="http://www.microhope.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.microhope.org</a> [3] IUAC:  <a href="http://iuac.res.in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://iuac.res.in/</a> [4] PSL: <a href="http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/</a></p></description>

				<title>Physical Open Source  Gaming - How to Build Your own Customized Game Controller for Multiplayer Fun</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Tech Kids II</track>
				<type>Workshop of 4 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In this workshop, we will show you our own special twist on the Internet of Things. Using an Espresso Lite (that's no coffee - this is actually a little computer with wifi) we will turn some household goods and some wire into your own multiplayer game controller. You will learn a lot about electronics, networking, and how much fun it is to build an open source community when we explore some of the open source projects, who enabled me to build the software for these controllers. And of course, we will play at least one fun open source multiplayer game with our own controllers in the end of the class. I will also point you to many other open source game projects you can adapt to use your new customized game controller with the knowledge of this class.  Bring some basic computer literacy (no programming required but it helps to dig deeper), some curiosity, a laptop, team spirit, and the willingness to do some crafting (yes there will be scissors and glue).</p></description>

				<description><p>Let's talk systemd in this BoF-like workshop. If you have any question regarding systemd, about using it, about hacking on it, about its future and our plans, then come this session. If you'd like to know more about the any facet of systemd, and never dared to ask, this is the place to come!  The idea of this session is that we discuss whatever interests you, the audience! Hence, please come up with good topics!</p></description>

				<title>Using the systemd Journal for Your Daily Work</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Linux and MiniDebConf</track>
				<type>Workshop of 1 hour</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>At this workshop we want to dive into the systemd journal, and how to use it for your daily devops or administrator work. The systemd journal is systemd's logging infrastructure and hence a core component of pretty much all modern Linux systems.   Specifically, we'll play around with "journalctl" and related tools and what they can do for you. We'll particularly focus in filtering log output and structured logging, and everything else that makes the journal more powerful than "cat /var/log/syslog". Please bring your own laptop to this workshop. Please install a major distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu, …), that has adopted systemd (which is pretty much any, as long as it is somewhat recent). Some of the features we'll show rely on very new features of the systemd journal, hence the newer version you pick the better. But even if you don't want to bring your own laptop, it should still be useful to follow this workshop without any.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>GNOME 3.20 is just around the corner! It's due on 21st of March. With that release, many visible improvements will be delivered to users around the world.    While many people already excitedly use GNOME 3 with the new user experience, some features of the new and elegant desktop like LibreOffice integration or editing photos with non-destructive GEGL operations are not yet wildly known. We also did many things on the plumbing layer such as allowing GNOME to run Wayland.  The talk will introduce to some of the design philosophies inherent in GNOME 3 as well as the main changes brought to users and developers. Also, since GNOME 3.20 is another step of a long lasting incrementally improved user experience, the future of GNOME's development will be speculated on.</p></description>

				<title>Reproducible Builds - fulfilling the original promise of free software</title>

				<track>Linux and MiniDebConf</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or "compiled") packages to end users.  The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical binary packages are always generated from a given source.  This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build.  Furthermore, a reproducible build has a wide variety technical advantages, including implicitly removing non-deterministic or unsafe behaviour (such as downloading third-party code from the internet), detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages.  In this sense, reproducible builds are finally fulfilling the original promise of free software  - that you have actual control over what is being run on your computers.</p></description>

				<description><p>Traditionally open source projects are not very famous for their good design. But there’s a new generation of modern, well-designed and widely used open source apps. There’s also a few more designers working in open soure now and an upcoming Open Source Design movement. But we still need to improve, and we need to collaborate! I worked as designer with lots of open source software projects and will present the methods I use every day at ownCloud to drive forward open source design. Some topics I will cover: - how to establish a design culture in your project - how to work together with developers - making designers develop and developers design - getting university students involved - the importance of cross-project collaboration - the Open Source Design movement in general</p></description>

				<description><p>You love code. You also love art. You want to merge the two wonderful worlds, but it can be hard. How can we create art with code and make writing code an art? In comes generative art! Generative art is art created by an independent, non-human system, for example, art generated by algorithms. Remember screensavers from the 90s? Yeah, something along those lines. You'll learn how to create art in the browser with Processing.js. I'll demo the basics of animation and we'll explore how algorithmic and mathematical concepts such as recursion, tiling, and geometry can result in unexpectedly beautiful visuals.</p></description>

				<description><p>Game Automators is an effort that's made to automate android games using Matlab, OpenCV, PIL etc.., Using these we are automating the games with the adb tools. The talk will focus on what the project is all about, the community to automate mobile gaming using image processing, the possible academic research areas and the future of gaming with game automation. It's also an exciting effort to build algorithms to focus on solving larger and more dynamic mobile games. We are currently putting all the findings and the tutorials into a book and FOSSASIA would be a great platform to showcase and reach out to other researchers, students and enthusiasts about the ongoing work.</p></description>

				<title>Scalable Datastores for a Containerized World: Crate</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>DevOps</track>
				<type>Workshop of 1 hour</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Web services were divided in three parts: Scalable frontends, application servers, and infrastructure. No, four parts, for one indomitable component still held out against the recent trend of containerization: Datastores.  While setting up stateless web- and application servers is considered best practise today, creating ethemeral datastores is still tricky. The talk will show that ethemeral datastores aren't implicit contradictions and discuss how to implement this idea. The main problem is to deal with scale-out and scale-back situations. There are several ways to tackle that challenge, including, but not limited to to active-passive-clusters, read slaves, active-active-solutions ora couple of NoSQL solutions. Most of them are pretty complex to set up and operate, though.  Crate is an open source database that speaks SQL to the frontend, but scales horizontally by just adding more nodes. A demo shows how to set up a distributed application with a database cluster using Docker in less than 15 lines of orchestration code and compares it to other database clusters.  Software architects, web developers, and system engineers who have experienced the pains of scaling a database up to a big data level will learn in this session how to resolve the bottleneck of poorly performing data backends. It includes a working demo participants may download and extend.</p></description>

				<description><p>Micro Social networks and messaging platforms are playing a huge role in shaping up the major internet usage in the world. There is a tremendous potential of using these platforms, these platforms already provide high security levels ensuring that the over head of security can be safely taken a step later and the developers can lay their core focus only on the main prototype. In this workshop we can explore the possibilities of using these message platforms in various ways, to control IOT at home and business as well as to create artificial intelligence to build better and more engaging customer experiences</p></description>

				<description><p>Loklak's APIs are very powerful, To make the utilization of these APIs much more, i had created the python-loklak-api which works as the main bridge to build the telegram bots in python as well as the main backbone behind the software solution called GEAR (Govt. Enhanced Administrative Resource) which is a dedicated open source software for tracking complaints registered with the government's. Started in 2014 December, this software is now being pilot tested in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the loklak API serves as the main tool for the governments to interact with citizens, A rant on twitter can now be taken seriously by the governments to improve the way they function.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>In this workshop, attendees will learn how to derive, simulate, control, and visualize the motion of a multibody dynamic system with Python tools. These methods and techniques play an important role in the design and understanding of robots, vehicles, spacecraft, manufacturing machines, human motion, etc. In particular, the attendees will develop code to simulate the motion of a human balancing while standing using specific Joints.  We have found that a broad audience enjoys the topic. Attendees should be familiar with the basics of the SciPy stack, in particular NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and IPython and have some familiarity with classical mechanics specially common joints like pin joint and sliding joints.</p></description>

				<subtitle/>
				<track>Big Data/Open Data</track>
				<type>Workshop of 2 hours</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>This workshop will enable participants to build client apps by consuming an open source Twitter API from the Loklak server. The workshop will help participants install and setup the Loklak server on their systems.  Once setup is complete, there will be a hands-on tutorial on how to consume the Loklak API to build client apps on various devices and languages. This will cover an overview and short tutorial of using the API wrappers and a thorough walk-through of the API methods. There will be demos of apps made for web, mobile and IOT. By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready with their own app consuming the Loklak API on a device and language of their choice. We can then have a short presentation session by the participants showcasing the apps they built during the workshop.</p></description>

				<description><p>Although high quality, general-purpose dictation is just barely outside our reach, modern speech recognition is well adapted to small-vocabulary, structured grammars like programming languages and voice user interfaces (VUIs). By providing alternative input mechanisms to traditional IDEs, we can improve accessibility for visually impaired programmers, and free developers from the paradigm of menu- and button- based navigation. In this presentation, we will demonstrate an open source tool that can navigate code, recognize simple commands, and help you write Java, just by listening to your voice. Written in Java and built on open source libraries, you too can integrate speech recognition in an IDE or desktop application of your choice, by using a few simple recipes.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring Oracle's MySQL Server execution at a low level. This versatile and tightly integrated component collects performance and session data from various subsystems within the server during runtime with minimal impact on overall server performance.  This feature was introduced in MySQL 5.5 and MySQL 5.7 GA has been released with great enhancements in it for performance monitoring and tuning.This talk aims to give an overview of Performance Schema and how/what statistical information user is provided with using Performance Schema. With the help pf few use cases, it also explains how that information can be used for monitoring and trouble shooting to track an issue back to the relevant file and line of code in source file.   This talk also aims to give a glimpse of new interesting features/monitoring information added in MySQL 5.7 GA.  This talk is targeted to many database users which includes DBA, Database Application developers, Database developers, Students etc.</p></description>

				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>MySQL Replication provides a solution for High Availability and Read Scale-Out. Replication ensures that data written on one MySQL server is made available on other MySQL servers at run time in a fast, consistent and fault tolerant manner with minimal impact to the overall performance of the server.  Traditionally, MySQL Replication supports a single master and many slaves, and it is either asynchronous or semi-synchronous. A new replication plugin for MySQL has been around for some time and this is named MySQL Group Replication. This plugin provides multi-master update everywhere capabilities, making it possible to update data, concurrently, on any server in a group. It provides additional synchronization between servers that makes them coordinate regarding transactions that are committed in the group.  This talk explains how MySQL Group Replication facilitates and improves High Availability and simplifies replication and application management - it will also include a demo.  Takeaways: - What's MySQL Group Replication and its evolution. - Understanding the architecture of MySQL Group Replication. - Demo on how to use MySQL Group replication for improved High   Availability.</p></description>

				<description><p>The Web of Trust is the decentralised PKI in the OpenPGP world. It depends on people participating by signing other people's keys. However, when following best practises, the act of signing a key involves secure transfer of the OpenPGP key which contemporary casual key signing protocols for small groups address by exchanging the fingerprint of the key to be signed. The key will then be downloaded over an untrusted channel and the key obtained needs to be manually verified.  This presentation shows a novel approach to signing keys which makes it easy to sign a person's key. It enables very small groups of people to casually hold very small key signing parties. The key idea is to automatically authenticate the key material before the transfer via a secure audible or visual channel. A Free Software implementation of the protocol will be shown and people are invited to sign their keys :-)</p></description>

				<description><p>Ring, a project from Savoir-faire Linux, creators of SFLphone, uses a distributed hash table instead of a central SIP server to find other users. This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's OpenDHT library.  Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.</p></description>

				<description><p>With the emerging security threats on this age, it is wiser to have an integrity checker on a daily basis to audit the system. And in my workshop, I will showcase the implementation and use of AIDE.  AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Enviornment) is a tool to check the file integrity. It is an opensource substitute for commercial tool TRIPWIRE. It allows to take snapshots of all the major configuration files, binaries as well as libraries stats. And helps to find which binaries have been changed in case of compromisation of the system.</p></description>

				<description><p>“The Other Nefertiti” is an artistic intervention by Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al- Badri which went viral. “With the data leak as a part of this counter narrative within our investigative practice we want to activate the artefact, to inspire a critical re-assessment of today’s conditions and to overcome the colonial notion of possession in Germany's museums”. With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the “Global North“ deals with heritage and the representation of “the Other”. “We should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.“   At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain:  <a href="http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>   Here is the video showing the scanning process:  <a href="https://vimeo.com/148156899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  “The Other Nefertiti”  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing “The Other” always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .</p></description>

				<description><p>HELP US PRESERVE THE ENDANGERED CULTURAL HERITAGE OF SYRIA BY CREATING A VIRTUAL #NEWPALMYRA DIGITAL TOOLS TO BUILD THE FUTURE FROM THE PAST  #NEWPALMYRA is: * A Digital Archaeology project, collecting data from international partners, analyzing it, creating a reconstruction of Palmyra in virtual space, and sharing the models and data in the public domain. We are using digital tools to preserve the heritage sites being actively deleted by ISIS. * A Cultural Development project, hosting live workshops and building a network of artists, technologists, archaeologists, architects, and others to research, construct models, and create artistic works. * A Curatorial project, creating exhibitions and experiences in museums and institutions globally, celebrating the cultural heritage of Syria and the world through the lens of architecture embodying culture and power.  Together with our international affiliates, #NEWPALMYRA sources archaeological and historical data, shares it with the community, and outputs art exhibitions, salons, and creative works using this data to carry the rich history of Palmyra forward to new generations.</p></description>

				<description><p>Creating patterns is like mapping the night sky. Constellations and clothing patterns are mathematically difficult to construct. This talk begins with the origins of the project and explains the challenges posed by the data, the data structures, and the user workflow.  The revolutionary nature of this open source fashion design tool is revealed in social, political, ecological and technical terms.</p></description>

				<description><p>It is possible to create and make your own PCB without the use of dangerous chemicals. Simply by using Vineger, Hydrogen Peroxide and Salt you are able to make fairly complex PCB boards. The process is simple and fast and gives you the flexibility to make 1 single board or multiple different prototype boards for testing.  This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board.</p></description>

				<description><p>This presentation is about the Sensor Plug-ins developed for ExpEYES : Pocket Science Lab as a part of my GSoC-2015 project with FOSSASIA.  We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc.  With this development we at FOSSASIA  are aiming to  provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world.  I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everyday…..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.</p></description>

				<title>Using the systemd Journal for Your Daily Work</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Linux and MiniDebConf</track>
				<type>Workshop of 1 hour</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>At this workshop we want to dive into the systemd journal, and how to use it for your daily devops or administrator work. The systemd journal is systemd's logging infrastructure and hence a core component of pretty much all modern Linux systems.   Specifically, we'll play around with "journalctl" and related tools and what they can do for you. We'll particularly focus in filtering log output and structured logging, and everything else that makes the journal more powerful than "cat /var/log/syslog". Please bring your own laptop to this workshop. Please install a major distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu, …), that has adopted systemd (which is pretty much any, as long as it is somewhat recent). Some of the features we'll show rely on very new features of the systemd journal, hence the newer version you pick the better. But even if you don't want to bring your own laptop, it should still be useful to follow this workshop without any.</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>GNOME 3.20 is just around the corner! It's due on 21st of March. With that release, many visible improvements will be delivered to users around the world.    While many people already excitedly use GNOME 3 with the new user experience, some features of the new and elegant desktop like LibreOffice integration or editing photos with non-destructive GEGL operations are not yet wildly known. We also did many things on the plumbing layer such as allowing GNOME to run Wayland.  The talk will introduce to some of the design philosophies inherent in GNOME 3 as well as the main changes brought to users and developers. Also, since GNOME 3.20 is another step of a long lasting incrementally improved user experience, the future of GNOME's development will be speculated on.</p></description>

				<title>Reproducible Builds - fulfilling the original promise of free software</title>
				<subtitle/>
				<track>Linux and MiniDebConf</track>
				<type>Talk of 20 minutes</type>
				<language/>
				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or "compiled") packages to end users.  The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical binary packages are always generated from a given source.  This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build.  Furthermore, a reproducible build has a wide variety technical advantages, including implicitly removing non-deterministic or unsafe behaviour (such as downloading third-party code from the internet), detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages.  In this sense, reproducible builds are finally fulfilling the original promise of free software  - that you have actual control over what is being run on your computers.</p></description>

				<description><p>Traditionally open source projects are not very famous for their good design. But there’s a new generation of modern, well-designed and widely used open source apps. There’s also a few more designers working in open soure now and an upcoming Open Source Design movement. But we still need to improve, and we need to collaborate! I worked as designer with lots of open source software projects and will present the methods I use every day at ownCloud to drive forward open source design. Some topics I will cover: - how to establish a design culture in your project - how to work together with developers - making designers develop and developers design - getting university students involved - the importance of cross-project collaboration - the Open Source Design movement in general</p></description>

				<abstract><p>Short Abstract for the event</p></abstract>
				<description><p>You love code. You also love art. You want to merge the two wonderful worlds, but it can be hard. How can we create art with code and make writing code an art? In comes generative art! Generative art is art created by an independent, non-human system, for example, art generated by algorithms. Remember screensavers from the 90s? Yeah, something along those lines. You'll learn how to create art in the browser with Processing.js. I'll demo the basics of animation and we'll explore how algorithmic and mathematical concepts such as recursion, tiling, and geometry can result in unexpectedly beautiful visuals.</p></description>

				<description><p>Game Automators is an effort that's made to automate android games using Matlab, OpenCV, PIL etc.., Using these we are automating the games with the adb tools. The talk will focus on what the project is all about, the community to automate mobile gaming using image processing, the possible academic research areas and the future of gaming with game automation. It's also an exciting effort to build algorithms to focus on solving larger and more dynamic mobile games. We are currently putting all the findings and the tutorials into a book and FOSSASIA would be a great platform to showcase and reach out to other researchers, students and enthusiasts about the ongoing work.</p></description>

				<description><p>Ring, a project from Savoir-faire Linux, creators of SFLphone, uses a distributed hash table instead of a central SIP server to find other users. This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's OpenDHT library.  Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.</p></description>

				<description><p>To the people who already know what a CryptoParty is: We are doing it, come!  To everyone else: Online communication is an important part of our lives. Unlike physical communication, we cannot control who can reach our data when we send it through the "inter-tubes." Fortunately, there are techniques to prevent people from eavesdropping your online conversations. In this workshop, I will talk about easy-to-use security tools that you can use to keep your conversations private: how to encrypt emails and instant messaging. It will be a not-so-technical workshop aimed to include anybody who knows how to use email.</p></description>

				<description><p>coala [1] provides an abstraction for static code analysis that is useful while still applicable to any text based language. coala provides convenient user interfaces for multiple usecases which takes away a lot of common tasks from the developer. In this process coala makes research available for production immediately and combines rapid prototyping with instant usability. coala also facilitates people entering the world of open source by providing them valuable feedback on coding standards and formatting in one consistent way for all languages.

				<description><p>The YouthMobile Initiative builds on the experience of many worldwide initiatives that introduce young people to computer science programming (learning-to-code) and problem solving (coding-to-learn). It also seeks to build on experiences targeting young women who are vastly underrepresented in this field. Finally it builds on the consideration that for millions of young people, the smartphone in their pocket is a very powerful computer, it will be their only computer, and they use it for nearly every aspect of their lives: communicating, learning, taking pictures, and playing games.</p></description>

				<description><p>Innovation depends on developing creative solutions for the complicated challenges we will be facing in the future, but what happens if we want to start innovating but we believe that we are not creative? The experiential booth will have tools and materials for participants to stop by and create a personalized coaster or greeting. Each participant can stay up to 20 min, as to let other people have a chance at making.</p></description>
